      The Lake Sunapee instrumented buoy is equipped with a thermistor chain comprised of ten integrated Nexsens TS210 units (July 2017 - current) and two Ponsel Digisens Optical probes suspended at approximately 1.5 meters and 10.5 meters depth. Note that the below-surface depth of the thermistors have fluctuated throughout the years.
      
Lake Sunapee buoy is located near Loon Island Lighthouse during the summer months and in the Lake Sunapee Harbor during the winter months (2010-current) except for the first few years of data collection (2007-2010), when the buoy was located near Loon Island year-round. The buoy was moved to the harbor during the winters after suffering ice damage, sensor failures, and general data transmission errors during the winter of 2009-2010.
      
In two instances, HOBO units were deployed at the buoy's location when sensors failed mid-season (thermistor line mid-2015, HOBO temp/lumen pendants deployed in place) or if sensors were unavailable for the season (2018, a HOBO U26 dissolved oxygen sensor was deployed when DO probes were not functioning).
      
All datasets have been QAQC'd to remove obviously errant readings, highly suspicious readings, and artifacts of buoy maintenance.

        Lake Sunapee is located in the Sugar River watershed within Sullivan and Merrimack Counties, NH, USA. It is a drainage lake with predominantly muck substrate. It has a surface area of 1667 hectares, 53 kilometers of developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 33.7 meters. The location of the buoy is 43.3913, -72.0576.  The ice-on harbor position for winters starting in 2010 forward: 43.3857, -72.0812. Verbal description of summer buoy location: SSE of Loon Island, water depth 10.5-12m, water fluctuations seasonally 0.75 to 1 meter. The following bounding coordinates are for Lake Sunapee as defined by the polygon contained in the New Hampshire Hydrography Dataset (NHHD) as downloaded from GRANIT (http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu/data/search?dset=nhhd&#).

          The Lake Sunapee instrumented buoy is equipped with a thermistor chain comprised of ten integrated Nexsens TS210 units (July 2017 - current). Previously, the thermistor chain was comprised of Nexsens T500 Node thermistors (December 2010-July 2017) and before December 2010, it was instrumented with TempLine thermistors from Apprise Technology. During the summer of 2015 (August-September), a HOBO temperature string was deployed on the buoy in place of the thermistors while the thermistors were being serviced. Prior to July 2017, the reported depths of the thermistor line are best approximations and are likely correct within 0.25 meters. Depths of thermistors, which have fluctuated over the years, are indicated by the column headings in the included temperature file (2007-2020_tempstring_L1.csv).
          
Dissolved oxygen is currently monitored at two depths (approximately 1.5 meters and 10.5 meters) by Ponsel Digisens Optical probes at the 1.5 meter depth (since June 2015) and the 10.5 meter depth (since September 2013). Prior to September 2013, DO was only measured at 1.5 meters depth. Prior to June 2015, dissolved oxygen at 1.5 meter depth was measured by a D-Opto SDI 12 dissolved oxygen probe. A HOBO U26 dissolved oxygen unit was deployed at 0.25 meters depth in May 2018 because the Ponsel probe had failed.
          
Data from the thermistor chain and dissolved oxygen probes were collated and cleaned using R Studio (v. 1.2.504), R version 4.0.3 by B. Steele of K.C. Weathers' Laboratory (R code for QAQC included in this data package). QAQC consisted of renaming columns from the raw data to common headings for consistency between data years, as well as recoding obviously errant readings, highly suspicious readings and artifacts of buoy maintenance to 'NA' from the raw data.  Data from HOBO sensors in 2015 (9 HOBO temp/lumen pendants at 0.5 meters to 8.5 meters depth) and HOBO U26 during 2018 (1 HOBO U26 dissolved oxygen probe) were QAQC'd in the same manner as the data from the buoy. 
          
The underwater temperature data are broken into two records: (1) the dataset from the thermistors attached to the buoy only (2007-2020_tempstring_L1.csv), and (2) the dataset from the summer 2015 deployment of the HOBO sensors in place of the thermistors (2015_summerhobo_L1.csv). Dissolved oxygen data are also broken into two records: (1) the dataset from the dissolved oxygen probes connected to the buoy data logger (2007-2020_do_L1.csv), and (2) the dataset from 2018 where a HOBO U26 dissolved oxygen probe was deployed at 0.25 meters in place of the failed Ponsel DO units.
